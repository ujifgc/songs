[Intro]

Am F C G/B  x8


[Verse]

Am          F
You were a child
                   C                G/B
Crawling on your knees toward him
Am               F
Making momma so proud
C                      G/B        Am   F
But your voice is too loud
                  C           G/B
We like to watch you laughing
Am                          F
You pick the insects off of plants
C                         G/B
No time to think of consequences


[Chorus]

Am                F
Control yourself
                    C             G/B
Take only what you need from it
Am          F           C       G/B
A family of trees wanting to be haunted

Am                F
Control yourself
                    C             G/B
Take only what you need from it
Am          F           C       G/B
A family of trees wanting to be haunted


[Verse]

Am          F
The water is warm
                 C             G/B
But it's sending me shivers
Am           F
    A baby is born
C                  G/B
  Crying out for attention
Am             F
   The memories fade
                       C                G/B
Like looking through a fogged mirror
Am
    Decisions too
  F                        C
Decisions are made and not bought
                            G/B
But I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot, I guess not


[Chorus]

Am                F
Control yourself
                    C             G/B
Take only what you need from it
Am          F           C       G/B
A family of trees wanting to be haunted

Am                F
Control yourself
                    C             G/B
Take only what you need from it
Am          F           C       G/B
A family of trees wanting to be haunted
