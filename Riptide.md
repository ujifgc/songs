[Intro]
Am 3 G C
Am G C

[Verse 1]
Am              G                C
I was scared of dentists and the dark
Am              G                C
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
    Am         G               C
Oh, all my friends are turning green
           Am          G                 C
You're the magician's assistant in their dreams

[Pre-chorus]
Am   G    C
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Am   G             C
Ooh, ooh, and they come unstuck

[Chorus]
Am    G                   C
Lady, running down to the riptide, taken away
       Am         G               C
To the dark side, I wanna be your left hand man
  Am       G                        C
I love you when you're singing that song, and I got a lump
      Am             G                     C
In my throat, 'cause you're gonna sing the words wrong

[Verse 2]
Am                 G                   C
There's this movie that I think you'll like
     Am             G                C
This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
     Am       G            C
This cowboy's running from himself
    Am                G                C
And she's been living on the highest shelf

[Pre-chorus]
Am   G    C
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Am   G             C
Ooh, ooh, and they come unstuck

[Chorus]
Am    G                   C
Lady, running down to the riptide, taken away
       Am         G               C
To the dark side, I wanna be your left hand man
  Am       G                        C
I love you when you're singing that song, and I got a lump
      Am             G                     C
In my throat, 'cause you're gonna sing the words wrong

[Solo] (fingerpicking)

[Bridge]
Am                         G
I just wanna, I just wanna know
C                                  Fmaj7
If you're gonna, if you're gonna stay
Am                             G
I just gotta, I just gotta know
C                                Fmaj7
I can't have it, I can't have it any other way

[Pre-chorus] (strum once and hold)
  Am          G                C
I swear she's destined for the screen
Am               G                 C
Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh

[Chorus]
Am    G                   C
Lady, running down to the riptide, taken away
       Am         G               C
To the dark side, I wanna be your left hand man
  Am       G                        C
I love you when you're singing that song, and I got a lump
      Am             G                     C
In my throat, 'cause you're gonna sing the words wrong

[Chorus]
Am    G                   C
Lady, running down to the riptide, taken away
       Am         G               C
To the dark side, I wanna be your left hand man
  Am       G                        C
I love you when you're singing that song, and I got a lump
      Am             G                     C
In my throat, 'cause you're gonna sing the words wrong

[Chorus]
Am    G                   C
Lady, running down to the riptide, taken away
       Am         G               C
To the dark side, I wanna be your left hand man
  Am       G                        C
I love you when you're singing that song, and I got a lump
      Am             G                           C
In my throat, 'cause you're gonna sing the words wrong, I got a lump
      Am             G                           C
In my throat, 'cause you're gonna sing the words wrong
