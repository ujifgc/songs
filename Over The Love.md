```
Em                    D
Ever since I was a child
C               Fmaj7   Em
I’ve turned it all in my mind
Em
I sang by the piano
               D   
Tore my yellow dress
C         Fmaj7     Em
And cried, and cried, and cried


[Pre-Chorus]

D
I don’t want see what I’ve seen
Am
To undo what has been done
C
Turn off all the lights
Bm        D     Em D Cmaj7    Bm D
Let the morning come,         come


[Chorus]

Em                         D     Am
Now there's green light in my eyes
         Em      D     Am
And my lover of my mind
                       Em                      
And I’ll sing from the piano
G              Am              
Tear my yellow dress
Em        D       Am
And cry, and cry, cry

Over the love of you


[Verse 2]

    Em                       D
All this champagne, drunken home
                      C               
Against the current, all alone
Fmaj7                Em
Everybody see, I love him
Em
'Cause it’s a feeling that you get
D
When the afternoon is set
C             Fmaj7   Em
On the bridge into the city


[Pre-Chorus]

D
I don’t want see what I’ve seen
Am
To undo what has been done
C
Turn off all the lights
Bm        D    Em D Am    
Let the morning come          


[Chorus]

Em                     D     Am
Love is green light in my eyes
      Em      D     Am
And my lover of my mind
                       Em
And I’ll sing from the piano
G              Am
Tear my yellow dress
Em        D       Am
And cry, and cry, cry


[Bridge]

G
'Cause you’re a hard soul to save
D6
With an ocean in the way
C
But I’ll get around it
Am7
I’ll get around it
G
'Cause you’re a hard soul to save
D6
With an ocean in the way
C                    Am7  
But I’ll get around it


[Chorus]

Em                     D     Am
Love is green light in my eyes
      Em      D     Am
And my lover of my mind
                       Em
And I’ll sing from the piano
G              Am
Tear my yellow dress


[Outro]

( Em  D  C  Am )
And cry, and cry, cry
Over the love of you
Crying, crying, crying
Over the love you
Crying, crying, crying
Over the love you
Cry, cry, cry, cry
Over the love you
I can see the green light
I can see it in your eyes
I can see the green light
