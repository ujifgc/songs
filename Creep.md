C 3 E F Fm

[Verse 1]
                     C                              E
When you were here before, couldn't look you in the eyes
                    F                         Fm
You're just like an angel, your skin makes me cry
                 C                      E
You float like a feather in a beautiful world
             F                          Fm
I wish I was special, you're so fucking special

[Chorus] (play loud)
G (x3, very short)
          C            E
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
                         F               Fm
What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here

[Verse 2]
                   C                      E
I don't care if it hurts, I wanna have control
                 F                      Fm
I want a perfect body, I want a perfect soul
              C                    E
I want you to notice when I'm not around
                  F                     Fm
You're so fucking special, I wish I was special

[Chorus] (play loud)
G (x3, very short)
          C            E
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
                         F               Fm
What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here

[Bridge] (play loud)
            C                  E
Oooh, oooh, she's running out again...
F                      Fm                
She's running out, she run, run, run...
C     E
Ruuuuuuuun...
F     Fm
Ruuuuuuuuuuun...

[Verse 3] (play soft until the end)
                   C                   E
Whatever makes you happy, whatever you want
                  F                     Fm
You're so fucking special, I wish I was special

[Chorus]
          C            E
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
                         F               Fm
What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here
          C
I don't belong here
