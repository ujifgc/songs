[Verse 1]
Am    
I am in a rush,
Dm             E                  Am
I just have to pack my bag with cash, that flush,
Dm              E                F 
and it's certain to get back to my country,
F                   E             Am
didn't know that it's forbidden, I'm sorry.

[Chorus]
Am           Dm     E      Am 
I am just a simple Russian girl,
         Dm       E    F      
I've got vodka in my blood,
F                Am      F       
So I dance with brown bears,
          E           Am
And my soul is torn apart...
     F           Am    F
Oh I dance with brown bears,
        E            Am
And my soul is torn apart.

[Verse 2]
Am
Now you know -
Dm            E            Am
It is common to forget about the law,
Dm            E             F 
When especially you love - it's like a tank,
F                 E               Am
it can drive you mad so you can rob a bank

[Chorus]
Am           Dm     E      Am 
I am just a simple Russian girl,
         Dm       E    F      
I've got vodka in my blood,
F                Am      F       
So I dance with brown bears,
          E           Am
And my soul is torn apart...
     F           Am    F
Oh I dance with brown bears,
        E            Am
And my soul is torn apart.

[Verse 3]
Am    
Let me go,
Dm          E            Am
I won't ever try to do this anymore,
Dm                E                  F 
If you let - I'll kiss you in your chicks three times,
F               E                Am
This is a tradition, don't you be surprised!

[Chorus]
Am           Dm     E      Am 
I am just a simple Russian girl,
         Dm       E    F      
I've got vodka in my blood,
F                Am      F       
So I dance with brown bears,
          E           Am
And my soul is torn apart...
     F           Am    F
Oh I dance with brown bears,
        E            Am    
And my soul is torn apart.
