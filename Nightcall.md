Am  G/B  F  Dm
Am  G/B  F  Dm


[Verse 1]

Am                              G/B            F    Dm 
I'm giving you a  night call to tell you how I feel 
          Am                    G/B             F         Dm
I want to drive you through the night, down the hills 
          Am          G/B                      F        Dm
I'm gonna tell you something you don't want to hear 
          Am                       G/B               F        Dm
I'm gonna show you where it's dark, but have no fear 


[Chorus]

F               G
There something inside you
Em           F
It's hard to explain
                G
They're talking about you boy
Em                   F
But you're still the same

F               G
There something inside you
Em           F
It's hard to explain
                G
They're talking about you boy
Em                   F
But you're still the same
