[Verse]
Em          C7M
  Another head hangs lowly
  G                 D/F#
Child is slowly taken
Em                  C7M
  And the violence caused such silence
  G               D/F#
Who are we mistaken
         Em
but you see, it's not me
          C7M
it's not my family
          G
in your head, in your head
                 D/F#
they are fighting
            Em
With their tanks, and their bombs,
            C7M
and their bombs, and their guns
          G                            D/F#
In your head, in your head they are cryin'

[Chorus]
         Em             C7M
In your head, In your head
     G               D/F#
Zombie, zombie, zombie êh êh
                Em             C7M
What's in your head, in your head
     G              D/F#
Zombie, zombie, zombie êh êh êh ôh

[Instrumental]
Em - C7M - G - D/F# (x2)

[Verse]
Em           C7M
  Another mother's breakin'
  G                D/F#
heart is taking over
Em                    C7M
  when the violence causes such silence
  G                D/F#
we must be mistaken
          Em                   C7M
it's the same old theme since 1916
         G              
in your head,in your head
                      D/F#
they're still fightin'
            Em        
With their tanks and their bombs
         C7M            
And their bombs and their guns
     G                                D/F#
In your head, in your head they are dying

[Chorus]
         Em             C7M
In your head, In your head
     G               D/F#
Zombie, zombie, zombie êh êh
                Em            C7M
What's in your head, in your head
     G               D/F#
Zombie, zombie, zombie êh êh êh ôh

[Outro]
Em - C7M - G - D/F# (x4)
Em
