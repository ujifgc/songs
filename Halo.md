G 2 Am Em C


[Verse 1]

G                        Am
Remember those walls I built
                            Em
Well baby they're tumbling down 
                                C
And they didn't even put up a fight
                          G
They didn't even make a sound
                         Am
I found a way to let you in 
                          Em
But I never really had a doubt 
                               C
Standing in the light of your halo 
                G
I got my angel now 


[Pre-Chorus]

                      Am
It's like I've been awakened 
                       Em
Every rule I had you breakin' 
                         C
It's the risk that I'm takin' 
                              G
I ain't never gonna shut you out 


[Chorus]

                        Am
Everywhere I'm looking now 
                           Em
I'm surrounded by your embrace 
                      C
Baby I can see your halo 
                            G
You know you're my saving grace 
                              Am
You're everything I need and more 
                            Em
It's written all over your face 
                      C
Baby I can feel your halo 
                    G
Pray it won't fade away 


                 G
I can feel your halo (halo) halo 
                Am
I can see your halo (halo) halo 
                 Em
I can feel your halo (halo) halo 
                C
I can see your halo (halo) halo 
    G
Woah... 


[Verse 2]
G                        Am
Hit me like a ray of sun
                            Em
Burning through my darkest night 
                            C
You're the only one that I want 
                            G
Think I'm addicted to your light 
                          Am
I swore I'd never fall again 
                               Em
But this don't even feel like falling 
                               C
Gravity can't forget 
                    G
To pull me to the ground again 


[Post-Chorus]

                      Am
It's like I've been awakened 
                       Em
Every rule I had you breakin' 
                         C
It's the risk that I'm takin' 
                              G
I ain't never gonna shut you out 


[Chorus]


                        Am
Everywhere I'm looking now 
                           Em
I'm surrounded by your embrace 
                      C
Baby I can see your halo 
                            G
You know you're my saving grace 
                              Am
You're everything I need and more 
                            Em
It's written all over your face 
                      C
Baby I can feel your halo 
                    G
Pray it won't fade away 

                 G
I can feel your halo (halo) halo 
                Am
I can see your halo (halo) halo 
                 Em
I can feel your halo (halo) halo 
                C
I can see your halo (halo) halo 
    G
Woah... 
G
