[Intro]
C 2 Em D

[Verse 1]
C              Em                      D
  I went too far when I was begging on my knees
C                   Em                     D
  Begging for your arms, for you to hold around me
C              Em                                 D
  I went too far and kissed the ground beneath your feet
C                     Em                      D
  Waiting for your love, waiting for our eyes to meet

[Chorus]
        C                  Em
Crying 'give me some love, give me some love and hold me
G                            D
Give me some love and hold me tight
    C                  Em 
Oh, give me some love, give me some love and hold me
G                            D
Give me some love and hold me tight.

[Verse 2]
C             Em                       D
  I went too far when I was begging on my knees
C                  Em                               D      
  When I cut my hands, so you could stand and watch me bleed?
C              Em                               D         
  I went too far and kissed the ground beneath your feet
C                    Em                       D
  Standing in my blood, it was a taste of bittersweet

[Chorus]
        C                  Em
Crying 'give me some love, give me some love and hold me
G                            D
Give me some love and hold me tight
    C                  Em 
Oh, give me some love, give me some love and hold me
G                            D
Give me some love and hold me tight.
[Interlude]
           C                Em
Why can't I turn around and walk away?
   G            D
Go back in time?
            C                Em
I'll have to turn around and walk away
 G           D
I can't stay, I have to walk away

[Bridge]
C                        Em
 I'm left behind with an empty hole
G                   D
  And everything I am is gone
C                      Em
 I tried to reach for another soul
G             D  
  So I can feel whole

[Pre-Chorus]
    C               Em
Oh, give me some love
    G               D
Oh, give me some love

[Chorus]
    C                  Em
Oh, give me some love, give me some love and hold me
G                            D
Give me some love and hold me tight
    C                  Em
Oh, give me some love, give me some love and hold me
G                            D
Give me some love and hold me tight

[Outro]
           C                Em
Why can't I turn around and walk away?
   G            D
Go back in time?
            C                Em
I'll have to turn around and walk away
 G           D
I can't stay, I have to walk away
