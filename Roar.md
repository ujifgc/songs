[Intro]
G Gsus2
  
[Verse]
G
I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
                   Gsus2/A
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
Em                            Gsus2/C
 So I sit quietly,    agreed politely

[Verse 2]
G
 I guess that I forgot I had a choice
          Gsus2/A
I let you push me past the breaking point
Em7                                   Gsus2/C
  I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything

[Pre-Chorus]
    G
You held me down, but I got up
               Gsus2/A
Already brushing off the dust
    Em7
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
                    Gsus2/C
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
    G
You held me down, but I got up
                Gsus2/C
Get ready cause I've had enough
  Em7
I see it all, I see it now

[Chorus]
          Gsus2/C
I got the eye of  
      G
the tiger, the fighter, 
                        Am
Dancing through the fire
      Em7                                 C           G
Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear   me roar      Louder, louder than a lion
      Em7                                      C           G
Cause I    am a champion and you're gonna hear     me roar
                                           Am         Em7
Oh oh oh... oh oh   , Oh oh oh  oh  oh..., Oh oh oh...Oh oh oh  oh  oh...
                C            G        Gsus2
You're gonna hear    me roar

[Verse 3]
G
 Now I'm floatin' like a butterfly
                   Gsus2/A
Stingin' like a bee    I earned my stripes
Em                            Gsus2/C
  I went from zero, to my own hero

[Pre-Chorus]
    G
You held me down, but I got up
               Gsus2/A
Already brushing off the dust
    Em7
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
                    Gsus2/C
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
    G
You held me down, but I got up
                Gsus2/C
Get ready cause I've had enough
  Em7
I see it all, I see it now

[Chorus]
          Gsus2/C
I got the eye of  
      G
the tiger, the fighter, 
                        Am
Dancing through the fire
      Em7                                 C           G
Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear   me roar      Louder, louder than a lion
      Em7                                      C           G
Cause I    am a champion and you're gonna hear     me roar
                                 Am            Em7
Oh oh oh   oh oh   ,  Oh_ oh oh  oh  oh  oh...,    Oh_ oh oh oh   Oh  
                 C            G        Am   Em
You're gonna hear    me roar
                                 Am            Em7
Oh oh oh...,(Hey) Oh oh oh...,(You'll hear me roar) Oh oh oh...
                 C            G
You're gonna hear   me   roar   

[Interlude]
Am   Em   D

(soft/muted slowly building) 
D               D        D
   Roar, roar,  roar,   roar

[Chorus]
                      G
I got the eye of the tiger, the fighter, 
                       Am
Dancing through the fire
      Em                                    C           G
Cause I  am a champion and you're gonna hear    me roar  _
                       Am
Louder, louder than a lion
      Em7                                  C             G
Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear    me   roar
                               Am            Em7
Oh oh oh   oh oh... , Oh oh oh  oh oh oh..., (Yeah) Oh oh oh...
