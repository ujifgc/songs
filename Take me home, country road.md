[Verse]
C 2             Am             G                     F          C
Almost Heaven, West Virginia, Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River.
C                 Am                    G                           F
Life is old there, older than the trees, younger than the mountains, blowin 
         C
like a breeze.

[Chorus]
       C              G7         Am        F
Country Roads, take me home, to the place I belong
         C             G               F              C
West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads.

[Verse 2]
C                Am                G              F
 All my memories gather round her, miner's lady, stranger to blue 
C
water.
C                Am                  G                         F
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky, misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my 
 C
eye.

[Chorus]
        C              G7         Am        F
Country Roads, take me home, to the place I belong
         C             G               F              C
West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads.

[Bridge]
Am          G7/B        C
 I hear her voice in the morning hours she calls me
    F       C              G
the radio reminds me of my home far away.
     Am              A#             F             C
And driving down the road I get a feeling that I should have been home 
      G          G7
yesterday, yesterday.

[Chorus]
        C              G7         Am        F
Country Roads, take me home, to the place I belong
         C             G               F              C
West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads.

[Chorus]
        C              G7         Am        F
Country Roads, take me home, to the place I belong
         C             G               F              C
West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads.

[Outro]
         G             C
Take me home, country roads.
         G             C
Take me home, country roads.
